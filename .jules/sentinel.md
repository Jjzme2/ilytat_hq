## 2024-05-22 - [Missing Authentication in Document API]
**Vulnerability:** The `server/api/docs` endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE) lacked authentication checks, allowing unrestricted access to sensitive document storage (R2 bucket).
**Learning:** Nuxt server routes do not inherit authentication automatically. `server/utils/adminAuth.ts` exists but was not utilized in these endpoints.
**Prevention:** Always invoke `verifyAdminToken(event)` at the beginning of `defineEventHandler` for any API route that handles sensitive data or operations.
