## 2026-02-13 - [Critical] Unprotected S3 Proxy Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `server/api/docs.get.ts` endpoint proxied requests to Cloudflare R2 without any authentication or authorization checks.
**Learning:** Server-side API routes that act as proxies to external storage must always validate authentication before forwarding requests. Relying on obfuscated URLs is not security.
**Prevention:** Always add `verifyAdminToken` or equivalent middleware at the start of any server-side API handler that accesses sensitive data.
